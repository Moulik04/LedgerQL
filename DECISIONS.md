# Decisions

A running log of non-obvious design choices. Format: context → options → decision → consequence.

## 2026-09-02 — Package/dependency manager

**Context:** Need a Python 3.11+ environment manager with a lockfile, reproducible via `make setup` on a fresh clone.

**Options:**
- `pip` + `requirements.txt` — ubiquitous, no lockfile guarantees without extra tooling.
- `poetry` — mature, but slower resolver and heavier for a small project.
- `uv` — fast, single static binary, native lockfile, `uv run` pins the interpreter per-project.

**Decision:** `uv`, pinned to Python 3.12 for the project venv (system Python is 3.14, ahead of what some data/ML packages have wheels for yet).

**Consequence:** Contributors need `uv` installed (`brew install uv`) before `make setup`. Everything else is one command.

## 2026-09-02 — Repo scaffold before Phase 1 data work

**Context:** Phase 0 acceptance criteria: repo layout, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, pre-commit, pytest skeleton, `DECISIONS.md`, `README.md` stub, `.env.example`, MIT license, `make setup && make test` passing.

**Decision:** Module files under `ledgerql/` are created as typed stubs (docstring + `NotImplementedError` or pass) so imports resolve and the pytest skeleton is meaningful, without pre-building Phase 1+ logic.

**Consequence:** `make test` is green on an empty pipeline; real behavior lands module-by-module starting Phase 1.
